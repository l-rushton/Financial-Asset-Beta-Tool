# Asset-Beta-Tool
Compare the price movement of any two assets over a user specified time frame by calculating their beta.

Basic functionality is there, however I am currently working towards building a website which allows users to interact with the program easier. This will be my first project to use HTML/CSS. I will be using Eel to connect the python program and the website.
